## What Does it Do?

This app is 2-fold using the swiss data that comes standard in R. 

First it creates a linear model for fertility using whichever variable the user decides to add to the model using the checkboxes (Agriculture,Examination, Education, or Catholic).

The second thing it does is show a summary of the model using the variable chosen.

## How to Use it

Click on the checkbox you want to include in your linear model for fertility and click "calculate". The result will be a residuals vs fitted values plot. The summary of the linear model can then be viewed below the plot.
